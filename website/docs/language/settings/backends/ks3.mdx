# KS3

Stores the state as an object in a configurable prefix in a given bucket on [KingsoftCloud Standard Storage Service (KS3) ](https://en.ksyun.com/nv/product/KS3.html) (KS3).

This backend supports [state locking](/terraform/language/state/locking). Storing your state in a KS3 bucket requires the following permissions:

- `CreateTag`, `DeleteTag`, and `ListTags` on the tag key `ksyun-terraform-lock`
- `Put`, `Get`, and `Delete` files for the specified bucket's prefix

## Example Configuration

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "ks3" {
    bucket                      = "tf-backend"
    key                         = "terraform.tfstate"
    region                      = "cn-beijing-6"
    endpoint                    = "ks3-cn-beijing.ksyuncs.com"
    workspace_key_prefix         = "backend-dev/test"
  }
}
```

This assumes we have a [KS3 Bucket](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/kingsoftcloud/ksyun/latest/docs/resources/ks3_bucket) created named `tf-backend`,
Terraform state will be written into the file `terraform/state/terraform.tfstate`.

## Data Source Configuration

To make use of the KS3 remote state in another configuration, use the [`terraform_remote_state` data source](/terraform/language/state/remote-state-data).

```hcl
data "terraform_remote_state" "foo" {
  backend = "ks3"

  config = {
    region               = "cn-beijing-6"
    bucket               = "tf-backend"
    workspace_key_prefix = "backend-dev/test"
    endpoint             = "ks3-cn-beijing.ksyuncs.com"
    key                  = "terraform.tfstate"
  }
}

```

## Configuration Variables

!> **Warning:**  We recommend using environment variables to supply credentials and other sensitive data. If you use `-backend-config` or hardcode these values directly in your configuration, Terraform will include these values in both the `.terraform` subdirectory and in plan files. Refer to [Credentials and Sensitive Data](/terraform/language/settings/backends/configuration#credentials-and-sensitive-data) for details.

The following configuration options or environment variables are supported:

- `access_key` - (Optional) This is the Ksyun public key. It supports environment variables `KSYUN_ACCESS_KEY`.
- `secret_key` - (Optional) Secret key of Kingsoft Cloud. It supports environment variables `KSYUN_SECRET_KEY`.
- `endpoint` - (Optional) A custom endpoint for the KS3 API , It can be sourced from the `KSYUN_KS3_ENDPOINT` environment variable. the details of relationship of endpoint and region see [Endpoint and Region](https://docs.ksyun.com/documents/6761).
- `region` - (Optional) The region of the KS3 bucket. It supports environment variables `KSYUN_REGION`.
- `bucket` - (Required) The name of the KS3 bucket. You shall manually create it first.
- `workspace_key_prefix` - (Optional) The directory for saving the state file in bucket.
- `key` - (Optional) The path for saving the state file in bucket. Defaults to `terraform.tfstate`.
- `encrypt` - (Optional) Whether to enable server side encryption of the state file. If it is true, KS3 will use 'AES256' encryption algorithm to encrypt state file.
- `acl` - (Optional) Object ACL to be applied to the state file, allows `private` and `public-read`. Defaults to `private`.
- `max_retries` - (Optional) The maximum number of times an AWS API request is retried on retryable failure.
- `lock_duration` - (Optional) Sets the lock's duration. Generally speaking, the lock will be destroyed after the Terraform operations. Unfortunately, the lock is leaved because of the Terraform process is terminated. So, `lock_duration` field is provided that canned set it in order to deal with **the dead lock**. **Warning:** if `lock_duration` value is insufficient for your operation, the remote state file may be not your expectation, because of the operation race probably caused. Valid Value: `0`: ignore the existed lock, `-1`: unlimited, `number[mh]`: number, natural number, is time length; `m` is minutes; `h` is hours.


### Assume Role
If provided with an assume role, Terraform will attempt to assume this role using the supplied credentials.

The following arguments on the top level are deprecated:

* `assume_role_duration_seconds` - (Optional) Number of seconds to restrict the assume role session duration.
* `assume_role_policy` - (Optional) IAM Policy JSON describing further restricting permissions for the IAM Role being assumed.
* `assume_role_policy_arns` - (Optional) Set of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of IAM Policies describing further restricting permissions for the IAM Role being assumed.
* `assume_role_tags` - (Optional) Map of assume role session tags.
* `assume_role_transitive_tag_keys` - (Optional) Set of assume role session tag keys to pass to any subsequent sessions.
* `role_krn` - (Optional) KingsoftCloud Resource Name (KRN) of the IAM Role to assume.
* `session_name` - (Optional) The session name to use when assuming the role. If you ready to assume a role, must set `session_name`. It can be sourced from the `ENV_ASSUME_ROLE_SESSION_NAME` environment variable.
Usage:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    ksyun = {
      source = "kingsoftcloud/ksyun"
    }
  }

  # store state file into ks3
  backend "ks3" {
    bucket               = "tf-backend"
    key                  = "terraform.tfstate"
    region               = "cn-beijing-6"
    endpoint             = "ks3-cn-beijing.ksyuncs.com"
    workspace_key_prefix = "backend-dev/test"
    # access_key                  = ""
    # secret_key                  = ""
    role_krn = "krn:ksc:iam::user_id:role/tf-backend-role"
    session_name = "backend-test-assume-role"
    assume_role_duration_seconds = 3600
  }
}
